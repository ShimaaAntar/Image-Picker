 ## Request runtime permissions
  Every Android app runs in a limited-access sandbox.You can create a permission request and declare a runtime permission if your programme wants access to resources or data outside of its own sandbox.

  ### The basic principles for requesting permissions at runtime are as follows:
    - Ask for a permission in context, when the user starts to interact with the feature that requires it.
    - Don't block the user. Always provide the option to cancel an educational UI flow, such as a flow that explains the rationale for requesting permissions.
    - If the user denies or revokes a permission that a feature needs, gracefully degrade your app so that the user can continue using your app, possibly by disabling the feature that requires the permission.
